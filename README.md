# Data Structures ++
This repo deines a list of Data Structures that are being used by other Wiggly-Games projects.
These Data Structures are written with C++, which allows us to be more specific on things like memory vs. other languages like NodeJS.

# List of Data Structures
## Bag
The Bag is defined within the Bag folder. It can be included into projects by including Bag.h.
This structure implements the statistical version of a bag, i.e., one that allows you to insert elements and then draw an element at random.
It's designed with a focus on reducing memory vs. other structures like a list.
